Iris ML Classifier – My First Machine Learning Project
This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning model built using Python and the Iris dataset, one of the most well-known datasets in the data science community.

The goal is to accurately classify iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The project follows a complete ML pipeline:

Data Loading & Exploration with pandas and seaborn

Feature Scaling using StandardScaler

Model Training with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scikit-learn

Model Evaluation using Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report

Data Visualization for better understanding and insights

The model achieves over 97% accuracy on the test set.

✅ Technologies Used:

Python 3

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn (KNN, evaluation metrics)
